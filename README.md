## Other Notes

About halfway through, I got the projects page workable to the point where I could use it to track my own open items for this project. Very meta, but it felt pretty good to have a usable tool that I made from scratch.

I also learned that date comparison, while made easier by something like `date-fns`, is a bit of a hassle.
